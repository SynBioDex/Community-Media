\textbf{Title:}

SBOL Version 3: Data Exchange throughout the Bioengineering Lifecycle

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Summary:}

The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) allows knowledge about biological designs to be captured using a machine-tractable, ontology-backed representation built on top of Semantic Web technologies. In addition to representing genetic designs, SBOL Version 3 can
now be used to represent knowledge across multiple scales and throughout the entire synthetic biology workflow, from the specification of a single molecule or DNA fragment to tracking experimental workflows with complex samples or multicellular systems containing multiple interacting genetic circuits. This tutorial will discuss both the fundamentals of SBOL3 and experiences from its use in a variety of projects.

\vspace{\baselineskip}
This tutorial will provide the following to attendees:

\begin{itemize}
    \item an introduction to the SBOL3 data model
    \item examples of workflows built on SBOL3
    \item hands-on experience with SBOL3 libraries and related tools
    \item an understanding of how to build extensions using SBOL Factory
\end{itemize}
